Joining the air force

The most memorable moment in my life is when I join the air force. When I was 20 years old, I enlisted in the air force. I was so sad that I can't meet my family and friends anymore. So I cried a lot.

There were my parents to saw me off. My father has already finished his military service. So he understood my mind, just smoked a lot. My mom just cried a lot.

It was July 23rd, 2018. And the enlistment ceremony was held in JinJu Air Force Education & Training command.

I was seperated from society. It was happened because I was a Korean male.

I learned the importance of relationships between people through this event.
